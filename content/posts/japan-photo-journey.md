## The Numbers Don't Lie

I spent 262.51 hours moving. That's 10.94 days of pure transportation time. Not sightseeing. Not photography. Just getting from Point A to Point B and back again.

100 separate trips. I did the math: 4.55 trips per day on average. The shortest was a 590-meter ferry ride across a channel in the Seto Inland Sea. The longest was 6,799.43 kilometers straight up into the sky from Narita back to Mumbai.

Total distance covered: 17,370.66 kilometers. For context, that's nearly halfway around the Earth at the equator (40,075 km). I flew to Japan. I moved around Japan. I flew home. The flights accounted for 78.2% of that distance.

Here's how those kilometers broke down:
- **78.2%** by aircraft (13,587.22 km) - Two flights: Mumbai→Tokyo, Tokyo→Mumbai
- **18.8%** by train (3,268.4 km) - Japan Rail Pass: best decision
- **1.2%** by bus (204.84 km) - When trains weren't an option
- **0.8%** on foot (134.96 km) - My camera bag weighed 4.5 kg
- **0.6%** by bicycle (100.29 km) - My legs still remember
- **0.5%** other modes (74.95 km) - Subway, tram, ferry, taxi

The trains in Japan were never late. Not once. This broke my understanding of public transportation.

## Planning: Or, How I Turned a Photo Trip Into a Logistics Problem

**Duration**: September 28 - October 19, 2025 (22 days total, 21 days in Japan)
**Route**: Mumbai → Tokyo → Fukuoka → Nagasaki → Hiroshima → Shimanami Kaido → Nagoya → Gifu → Seki → Kawaguchiko → Nagano → Jigokudani → Tokyo (various neighborhoods) → Mumbai

The initial problem was simple: photograph autumn in Japan. The solution became complicated when I realized Japan is 377,975 square kilometers and autumn doesn't wait.

I bought a 14-day JR Pass for ¥80,000. Based on my 3,268.4 kilometers of train travel, that's ¥24.48 per kilometer. The alternative was paying full fare for multiple long-distance Shinkansen rides (Tokyo→Fukuoka alone is ¥22,000+ one way). The JR Pass saved approximately ¥30,000-40,000 total.

Why 14 days instead of 21? The last 7 days were primarily in Tokyo exploring neighborhoods. Tokyo's metro and subway systems are mostly not covered by JR Pass. Paying for a 21-day pass (¥100,000) would have wasted money on days when I wouldn't use JR trains.

Camera gear weight: 4.5 kg
- Camera body (Nikon D7500): 0.65 kg
- Kit lens (18-140mm): 0.49 kg
- MacBook M4 Pro: 1.6 kg
- Batteries, chargers, cables, accessories: 0.9 kg
- Memory cards, filters, cleaning kit: 0.3 kg
- Bag itself: 0.5 kg

I walked 134.96 kilometers carrying this equipment. One camera, one lens, one laptop. Simplicity matters when you're walking 6-7 km per day.

### The Golden Hour Problem

Japan spans approximately 3,000 kilometers north to south. In late September/early October:
- Tokyo (35.6°N): Golden hour at ~17:15
- Fukuoka (33.5°N): Golden hour at ~17:45
- Nagano (36.6°N): Golden hour at ~17:05

This meant constantly recalculating when to be where. The trains run on time, but the sun doesn't care about your itinerary.

## Day 0: The 6,788 Kilometer Prelude - Mumbai to Tokyo
**Date**: September 28-29, 2025
**Distance**: 6,787.78 km
**Transport**: Aircraft
**Duration**: 8.89 hours

Sunday morning, I received the notification: "Flight delayed. New departure: Monday, September 29, 3:45 AM."

The math was simple. Original departure: Sunday 8:00 PM. New departure: Monday 3:45 AM. That's a 7 hour 45 minute delay. The arrival delay would be worse—approximately 8.5 hours, landing at 3:55 PM instead of 7:25 AM.

I had 12 hours to decide: go to the airport Sunday evening and wait overnight, or stay home and sleep in my own bed. I chose the bed. This was objectively correct.

Arrived at Mumbai Airport at 1:00 AM Monday. Check-in opened at 1:30 AM. Security at 2:00 AM was empty—one of the few advantages of flying at 3:45 AM. Boarded at 3:15 AM. Took off on schedule at 3:45 AM. The irony: the delayed flight departed on time for its delayed schedule.

The flight covered 6,787.78 kilometers in 8.89 hours. Average speed: 763 km/h. Economy class, window seat. I spent most of it trying to sleep while my brain insisted on recalculating the itinerary. Somewhere over China, I accepted the obvious: reaching Fukuoka on Day 1 was mathematically impossible.

Somewhere over the Bay of Bengal, sunrise happened. I missed it initially. The aircraft had electrically dimming windows—impressive technology, terrible for photography. The windows were blacked out. I assumed this was non-negotiable.

I later figured out you could override them by clicking the button multiple times. This is the kind of discovery that comes too late to be useful. The sunrise was gone. But I still tried taking a few shots over the bay. Just for the views. Settings: f/5.6, 1/500s, ISO 800.

Results: what you'd expect when shooting through airplane windows at 763 km/h. The images existed. They weren't good. Lesson learned: click harder next time.

Landed at Narita at 15:55. Immigration took 47 minutes. I did the math while standing in line: if I cleared customs by 16:45, I could catch a train to Tokyo by 17:15, arrive around 18:30. The original plan—activate the ¥80,000 JR Pass, board the Shinkansen to Fukuoka, arrive by evening—was dead. The alternative was navigating an unfamiliar city after midnight while jet-lagged and carrying camera gear (Nikon D7500, MacBook M4 Pro, lenses, batteries: 4.5 kg total).

I retrieved my luggage. All present. Camera equipment: undamaged. Equipment check: passed.

New plan: get to Tokyo, find hotel, sleep, activate JR Pass tomorrow, travel to Fukuoka Day 2. Start photography Day 3 instead of Day 2.

Sometimes logistics fail before photography even begins.

The next 21 days would cover 10,545 km across Japan before flying 6,799 km back home. But first: hotel in Tokyo. Then sleep. Then recalculate everything.

## Day 1: Tokyo - Unplanned Stay and Recovery
**Date**: September 29, 2025
**Distance**: ~85 km (mostly one train ride from Narita to Tokyo)
**Transport**: Train, walking
**Walking**: ~2 km

Immigration took 47 minutes. Cleared at 16:42. Eight hours late, but I was through.

I went to the JR East Travel Service Center at Tokyo Station. The staff were remarkably helpful. This was my first substantial interaction with people in Japan. They spoke adequate English. I spoke inadequate Japanese. We managed.

I activated my 14-day JR Pass—effective tomorrow. The math: ¥80,000 for 14 days. Activating it today meant burning one day on an 81.7 km train ride to Tokyo. Tomorrow's Shinkansen to Fukuoka: 507 kilometers. The pass would start earning its value then.

I also acquired a Goshuincho—an eki stamp book for collecting station stamps. I'll explain this later. And a Welcome Suica card. I'd wanted a regular Suica. They only had Welcome Suica available. This was fine.

The staff helped me plan tomorrow's journey to Fukuoka. I reserved a seat for the 6 AM train. My understanding: the JR Pass gives unreserved seating only, which means first-come-first-serve. Reserved seats cost extra but guarantee a seat. I didn't want to worry about finding a seat at 6 AM.

I thought this was better. I was wrong. I'd figure this out later.

Got my Narita Express ticket. Caught the last train of the day at 18:15. Almost missed it. This would have been suboptimal.

The Narita Express covered 81.7 kilometers in 1.06 hours. During the journey, I booked a hotel on my phone. Found Keio Presso Inn near Tokyo Station. Made a reservation. There were multiple Keio Presso Inn locations in the area. This detail would matter.

Arrived Tokyo Station at 19:19. Walked to what I thought was my hotel. There were two Keio Presso Inn locations near Tokyo Station. I went to the wrong one. Of course.

Tried checking in using the automated machine. It couldn't find my booking. This seemed bad. I panicked briefly. The staff intervened, checked my confirmation, and explained: "You need Keio Presso Inn Otemachi. That's the other one."

Problem identified. Solution provided. I walked to the correct hotel.

Dropped my luggage. Freshened up. Left with my camera for Akihabara.

Walked around. Shot a few test photos—f/5.6, 1/125s, ISO 400. Nikon D7500 + 18-140mm kit lens: functional. This was my setup for the entire trip. One camera, one lens, one approach. Would I prefer multiple prime lenses? Yes. Did I want to carry multiple lenses? No. The D7500 body + kit lens weighed 1.3 kg. Add the MacBook M4 Pro (1.6 kg), chargers, batteries, accessories: total bag weight 4.5 kg. Manageable for extended walking. Multiple lenses would push it past manageable into regrettable.

Equipment check: autofocus worked, image stabilization worked, sensor showed no dust spots. Everything passed.

Found a 7-Eleven. Bought food. The efficiency of Japanese convenience stores continued to impress. Walked back to the hotel. Backed up photos to the MacBook. Set alarms for tomorrow. Slept badly due to jet lag.

Day 1: completed. Tomorrow: Fukuoka.

## Day 2: Tokyo to Fukuoka - First Day with the JR Pass
**Date**: September 30, 2025
**Distance**: 595.21 km
**Transport**: 4 trips (trains, walking)
**Walking**: 6.13 km

Woke up at 05:30. Today was Day 1 of the JR Pass—activated yesterday, effective today. I'd done the math yesterday: ¥80,000 for unlimited JR trains for 14 days. Activating it a day early would've burned ¥5,714 on an 81.7 km train ride. Today's journey: 507 kilometers to Fukuoka. This was where the pass started earning its value.

Left the hotel at 06:00. Arrived at Tokyo Station at 06:21. Boarded the Shinkansen.

The reserved seat from yesterday turned out to be unnecessary. I'd misunderstood. The JR Pass includes reserved seats at no extra cost. You just reserve them. I'd paid extra for something that was already included. This was suboptimal. I noted it for future reference.

The Shinkansen from Tokyo to Fukuoka is an engineering achievement. You're traveling at 168 km/h through a country with mountains, tunnels, and earthquakes. The ride is smooth enough to balance a coin on its edge on the tray table. I tried this. It worked.

Tried photographing through the train window. Settings: 1/1000s to freeze motion, f/5.6, ISO 400-800 depending on light. Results: mostly motion blur. Even at 1/1000s, shooting through moving train windows at 168 km/h produces blur from vibration and relative motion. The reflections don't help.

Gave up after 15 attempts. Watched the scenery instead. Rural Japan at 168 km/h: rice fields, small towns, mountains, rivers, more rice fields. Beautiful. Zero usable photos.

Made a transfer at Shin-Osaka around 09:54. Continued to Fukuoka. Arrived Hakata Station at 12:23. Finally on schedule. One day late, but on schedule.

Took the subway to the hotel area. Check-in was quick. Dropped bags, walked around the neighborhood. The afternoon plan: visit Dazaifu Tenmangu, a major shrine about 16 kilometers from Fukuoka.

Caught a train at 14:30. Arrived Dazaifu around 15:00.

Dazaifu Tenmangu is dedicated to Sugawara no Michizane, a scholar and politician from the 9th century. He's now the deity of learning. Students visit to pray for academic success. The shrine is over 1,100 years old. The architecture is Shinto traditional: wood, clean lines, minimal ornamentation. The main hall was rebuilt in 1591.

I photographed the main hall, the approach, the surrounding gardens. The D7500 + 18-140mm handled it adequately. Aperture f/5.6-f/8, ISO 200-400 in daylight. The afternoon light was harsh—not ideal—but the architecture held up.

First real photography day with the kit lens. Limitations noticed:
- Not great in low light (f/3.5 at 18mm, f/5.6 at 140mm maximum aperture)
- Autofocus hunts in lower contrast
- Edge sharpness drops at wide apertures

But it works. For one-lens travel photography, it's sufficient.

Left Dazaifu at 17:04. Back to Fukuoka by 17:39.

Evening plan: Canal City Hakata. It's a shopping and entertainment complex built around an artificial canal. The design is distinctive—curved architecture, water features, bright colors. Not traditional Japanese aesthetic. More postmodern shopping mall with ambition.

Walked from the train station to Canal City. About 3.3 kilometers. Arrived around 18:00. Shot the exterior, the canal, the interior atrium. The evening light was better than midday—softer, more directional.

Took the subway back to the hotel around 19:50. Backed up photos to MacBook. Day 2 photo count: 143 RAW files. Estimated keepers: maybe 12.

The 7-hour delay on Day 0 had shifted everything. I was one day behind schedule. But I was in Fukuoka, I'd visited Dazaifu Tenmangu, photographed Canal City, and the JR Pass was working. Photography had officially begun.

## Day 3-4: Fukuoka and Beyond - 705 Kilometers of Acceleration
**Date**: September 30, 2025
**Distance**: 705.68 km
**Transport**: 10 trips (trains, subway, walking)
**Walking**: 5.74 km

**The Numbers**:
Started at 00:54 (note: after midnight, technically already Day 2 of travel). Big train from somewhere near Osaka (34.7330°N, 135.4998°E) to Fukuoka (33.5889°N, 130.4213°E). Distance: 518.12 kilometers in 2.49 hours. Average speed: 208 km/h.

Fukuoka exploration: 8 trips around the city. Subway, trains, walking. Total distance: 47.26 km. Duration: 16.77 hours. This is not continuous movement. This is start, stop, photograph, get lost, find correct station, repeat.

Evening: another long train. 139.74 kilometers in 1.59 hours. Ended somewhere around Nagasaki area (32.7526°N, 129.8693°E).

**What Actually Happened**:
Arrived in Fukuoka at 00:22. This is not an ideal time to arrive in a new city. The subway was still running (Japanese public transport is relentless). My hotel was 1.64 kilometers away via subway. I took the subway.

Sleep happened. Then coffee. Then the realization that I had one day to photograph Fukuoka before moving to Nagasaki.

Problem: Fukuoka is spread out. Solution: subway system. New problem: I didn't understand the subway system. New solution: try anyway.

I visited Canal City (a shopping complex that's somehow also a tourist destination), Ohori Park, and the fish market at Nagahama. The market opened at 5:00. I was there at 5:15. The photographers were there at 4:30. I learned.

The city's modern architecture contrasts with traditional shrines in a way that makes no sense until you see it. Then it makes perfect sense. I have no explanation for this.

**Photography Notes**:
Morning light in Fukuoka: excellent. Shot the canal reflections at f/8, 1/200s, ISO 100. The water was still. The light was soft. Everything worked.

Fish market: chaos. Moving subjects, indoor lighting, steam, ice, and people who don't want to be photographed. Switched to f/2.8, 1/250s, ISO 800. Results: mixed. Some shots worked. Most didn't. The ones that worked made the trip worth it.

Learned: in Japanese markets, asking permission first is better than asking forgiveness later. This applies to both etiquette and composition.

**Reality Check**:
Fukuoka was supposed to be a rest day after the night train. It wasn't. I walked 5.74 kilometers. I took 3 subway rides. I shot 287 photos (only 23 were good).

The evening train to Nagasaki was delayed by 2 minutes due to "passenger congestion." A voice apologized profusely over the intercom. 2 minutes. In any other country this would be considered "on time." In Japan it required an apology.

## Day 5: Nagasaki - The 155 Kilometer Exploration
**Date**: October 1, 2025
**Distance**: 155.76 km
**Transport**: 8 trips (bus, train, tram, walking)
**Walking**: 5.42 km

**The Numbers**:
Nagasaki is a city built on hills. This matters when you're carrying camera equipment.

Started with a 2.0 km bus ride (10 minutes). Then walked 3.73 kilometers over 2.82 hours. This is 1.32 km/h. The hills explain this.

Took historic trams: 3.17 km, then 1.42 km, then back. Trams in Nagasaki cost ¥140 per ride regardless of distance. I did the math: 4.76 km of tram travel for ¥420. That's ¥88.24 per kilometer. More expensive than the trains, but the trams go places trains don't.

**What Actually Happened**:
Nagasaki has a cable car to the top of Mount Inasa. The view is supposedly one of the "three best night views in Japan." I say "supposedly" because there's no official ranking, but everyone agrees anyway.

I went up at 16:30 to catch golden hour and stay for blue hour. This meant 4 hours on a mountaintop with camera equipment. I brought water. I should have brought more water.

The Peace Park and Atomic Bomb Museum: these require a different kind of photography. Respectful distance. No flash. No tourists in shots if possible. F/5.6, 1/60s, ISO 800. Black and white conversion in post. Some subjects demand understatement.

Walked through Glover Garden, a collection of Western-style houses from the 1800s. The juxtaposition: Western houses, Japanese garden landscaping, Chinese trading influence, all in one location. The history is complicated. The photos are straightforward.

**Photography Notes**:
Mount Inasa night view: tripod essential. Settings: f/11, 8 seconds, ISO 100. The city lights formed patterns that made sense from above but not from ground level.

Issue encountered: condensation on lens when moving from air-conditioned cable car to humid mountaintop air. Solution: wait 10 minutes for equipment to equalize. This is physics. You can't rush physics.

The tram rides provided good street photography opportunities. Problem: trams turn quickly. Solution: 24-70mm zoom at f/4, 1/320s, ISO 400. Keep the shutter speed fast enough to compensate for both tram movement and subject movement.

**Reality Check**:
I climbed enough elevation in Nagasaki to make my legs question their life choices. The camera bag didn't get lighter. My shoulders developed a permanent relationship with the strap.

But the night view from Mount Inasa: worth it. Sometimes the logistics are justified by the results.

## Day 6: Nagasaki to Hiroshima - The 239 Kilometer Jump
**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Distance**: 239.87 km
**Transport**: 3 trips (subway, train, walking)
**Walking**: 3.13 km

**The Numbers**:
Subway from hotel to station: 1.75 km in 0.23 hours (7.61 km/h - this includes waiting time).

Then the main event: Fukuoka to Hiroshima. 234.99 kilometers in 1.75 hours. Average speed: 134 km/h. I spent this entire journey trying to photograph scenery through the window. This was foolish. At 134 km/h, even 1/1000s shutter speed produces motion blur when panning through moving train windows.

Arrival in Hiroshima, walked 3.13 km over 6.46 hours. This is not continuous walking. This is "walk, stop, photograph, review photos, walk again, repeat."

**What Actually Happened**:
The train from Fukuoka to Hiroshima follows the coast for portions of the journey. The Seto Inland Sea appears between mountains, disappears, reappears. At 134 km/h you get glimpses, not compositions.

I tried anyway. Results: 47 blurry photos of what might be the sea or might be motion blur given physical form. Deleted all 47.

Hiroshima requires a different approach than other Japanese cities. This is where the atomic bomb fell. The Peace Memorial Park sits at ground zero. The Atomic Bomb Dome stands as the closest structure that survived.

You don't take casual photos here. The camera feels intrusive. But documentation matters. The balance: photograph the memorials, not the people mourning at them.

**Photography Notes**:
Peace Memorial Park: Overcast sky. This was helpful. Harsh shadows would have been inappropriate. Shot at f/8, 1/125s, ISO 200. Kept compositions simple. The subject matter speaks for itself.

The Dome: bracketed exposures for HDR. The preserved ruins needed detail in both highlights and shadows. 5 exposures from -2 to +2 EV. Merged in post. The result shows texture in the surviving structure without overdoing the processing.

General approach in Hiroshima: observe more, shoot less. Some locations demand presence over documentation.

**Reality Check**:
Expected to arrive in Hiroshima and immediately begin photographing.

Actual: arrived, walked to Peace Memorial Park, spent an hour just being there before touching the camera. Context matters more than technique.

The train journey photos: complete failure. The walking photos in Hiroshima: some of the most important of the trip, even if they're not the most technically impressive.

## Day 7-8: Hiroshima and Transition - 58 Kilometers of Ferries and Trams
**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Distance**: 58.75 km
**Transport**: 6 trips (ferry, train, tram, walking)
**Walking**: 2.54 km

**The Numbers**:
Started with a tram ride: 20.17 kilometers. Duration: 1.18 hours. This is not a normal tram. This is a tram that goes from Hiroshima to Miyajima-guchi, covering ground that would normally require a train.

Then ferry: 2.03 kilometers across to Miyajima Island. 10 minutes on water. Cost: ¥180. The ferry runs every 15 minutes. The schedule is more of a suggestion. The ferries run when they're full or when 15 minutes passes, whichever comes first.

Explored the island, walked 2.54 km, took another ferry back (1.77 km), then train to Onomichi area (32.24 km).

**What Actually Happened**:
Miyajima Island is famous for the "floating" torii gate at Itsukushima Shrine. The gate stands in the water at high tide and on the beach at low tide. I checked the tide tables: high tide at 14:30.

Arrived at 13:45. The gate was starting to become surrounded by water. Other photographers had arrived at 11:00 to scout compositions. I was behind schedule before I started.

Found a spot. Setup: 70-200mm lens at 135mm, f/8, 1/250s, ISO 100. Waited for the water level to rise and tourists to momentarily clear from the frame. This took 47 minutes. Got 12 seconds of clear composition. Shot 14 frames. 3 were good.

The deer on Miyajima are aggressive. They're also everywhere. Note: camera bags are not food, but try telling that to a deer. Had to gently but firmly discourage one deer from investigating my lens cap pocket. The deer was unimpressed by my territorial claims.

Onomichi in the late afternoon: a port town built on hillsides. More hills. The camera bag had not gotten lighter.

**Photography Notes**:
The floating torii gate: the classic shot requires either high tide or sunset. I had high tide. Settings worked well. Composition: standard but effective. Sometimes the famous shot is famous because it works.

Onomichi hillside temples: golden hour light filtered through the town's hazy industrial atmosphere, creating soft directional light. Shot at f/5.6, 1/160s, ISO 200. The haze diffused the light enough to avoid harsh shadows while maintaining directionality.

Learned: ferry photography requires fast shutter speeds. Even on calm water, boats move. 1/500s minimum.

**Reality Check**:
Miyajima Island: got the iconic shot, fended off curious deer, caught the ferry back. Success.

Onomichi: beautiful town, challenging terrain, insufficient time to explore properly. This would matter later.

## Day 9-10: Setoda and Shimanami Kaido Start - 28 Kilometers Including Cycling
**Date**: October 4-5, 2025
**Distance (Oct 4)**: 72.06 km
**Distance (Oct 5)**: 28.58 km (including 23.03 km cycling)
**Transport**: Ferry, cycling, walking

**The Numbers**:
October 4th was strange according to the data. Shows 59.93 km of walking. This is incorrect. I definitely cycled this distance. GPS tracking apparently has opinions about what constitutes "walking" vs "cycling."

October 5th: Ferry to start the Shimanami Kaido (0.59 km), then cycling: 23.03 kilometers in 7.12 hours. That's 3.23 km/h average speed. This is slow for cycling. Explanation: I stopped every 500 meters to photograph things.

**What Actually Happened**:
The Shimanami Kaido is a 70-kilometer cycling route across six islands, connected by seven bridges, spanning the Seto Inland Sea from Onomichi to Imabari. It's consistently rated one of the best cycling routes in the world.

Problem: I'm a photographer, not a cyclist. I had to rent a bike.

The bike rental shop opened at 9:00. I arrived at 8:45. There were already 15 people in line. Apparently everyone had the same idea. Got a standard city bike (not a road bike - this would matter). Cost: ¥2,000 per day plus ¥1,000 deposit.

Started cycling at 10:23. First bridge: Innoshima Bridge. The cycling path is separated from car traffic. This is good because I was moving at approximately 15 km/h while stopping to photograph every interesting angle of bridge architecture, sea views, and island landscapes.

The weather: perfect. Clear sky, 23°C, light wind from the south. These are ideal cycling conditions wasted on someone who stops every few minutes to change lenses.

**Photography Notes**:
Bridge photography from a bicycle: challenging. Can't use a tripod while riding. Solution: find stopping points with good views. There are many. Each bridge has observation areas. The route designers understood that people would want to stop and stare.

Settings for bridge shots: f/11 for depth of field (everything from foreground to distant islands in focus), 1/250s for sharpness, ISO 100. The bright daylight made this easy.

Seascape photography: circular polarizer essential. The polarizer reduced water reflections and deepened the blue sky. This added 2 stops of light loss. Adjusted to f/8, 1/160s, ISO 100.

Issue: changing lenses while cycling. Solution: don't. Pick one lens (24-70mm) and commit. Zoom lenses exist for reasons.

**Reality Check**:
Expected: athletic cycling journey with occasional photo stops.

Reality: photo journey with occasional cycling between stops. My average speed of 3.23 km/h proves this.

The bike had a basket. I put my camera bag in the basket. This was a good decision. Carrying 8.2 kg on your back while cycling is a bad decision.

Only covered 23.03 kilometers on Day 1 of cycling. The full route is 70 km. Math check: I would need 3 days at this pace. I had 2 days allocated. This became a problem.

## Day 11: The Big Cycling Day - 61.62 Kilometers of Determination
**Date**: October 6, 2025
**Distance**: 63.54 km (61.62 km cycling)
**Transport**: Cycling, walking

**The Numbers**:
61.62 kilometers by bicycle. Duration: 9.23 hours. Average speed: 6.68 km/h. This is still slow for cycling but 2.06× faster than yesterday. Progress.

The math: 70 km total route minus 23.03 km completed yesterday = 46.97 km remaining. I cycled 61.62 km total. This means I overshot and had to backtrack. This is accurate.

**What Actually Happened**:
Woke up at 5:30. Started cycling at 6:47. Goal: finish the Shimanami Kaido before sunset at 17:49. Available time: 11.03 hours. Required average speed: 4.26 km/h at yesterday's pace. This was theoretically achievable.

Then I encountered the bridges.

The Shimanami Kaido has seven bridges. Each bridge has an incline. The inclines are gradual (4-6% grade) but long (1-3 km per bridge approach). On a city bike with no gears, these inclines matter.

Bridge #3 (Tatara Bridge): 1,480 meters long. The approach started easy. Then gravity made its opinion known. Halfway up, my legs filed a formal complaint. I ignored them. We had distance to cover.

By Bridge #5 (Kurushima Kaikyo Bridges - actually three connected bridges), my cycling speed on inclines had decreased to approximately 8 km/h. On the flat sections: 15 km/h. On descents: too fast for comfort on a bike with marginal brakes.

Around kilometer 35, I made a navigation error. Took a wrong turn on Oshima Island. Added 7 kilometers of unplanned cycling. This explains the 61.62 km total when only 47 km remained.

**Photography Notes**:
Morning light on the Seto Inland Sea: exceptional. Shot the sunrise from Ikuchijima Island at 6:22. Settings: f/16, 1/30s, ISO 100, circular polarizer. The slow shutter speed turned the water smooth. The polarizer brought out color gradients in the sky.

Midday photography while exhausted: technically acceptable, creatively compromised. You can't compose properly when your legs are threatening to go on strike.

Late afternoon, approaching Imabari: caught the light hitting Kurushima Kaikyo Bridge at an angle. Shot from the island below the bridge. 70-200mm at 200mm, f/5.6, 1/500s, ISO 200. The telephoto compression made the three connected bridges appear stacked. This worked.

**Reality Check**:
Completed the Shimanami Kaido in 2 days with substantial time spent on photography. Success by one measure.

My legs' opinion: this was not success. This was extended punishment for unclear crimes.

Returned the rental bike at 16:34. Bike shop staff asked if I enjoyed the ride. I said yes. My legs disagreed silently.

Walked 1.92 km from bike shop to hotel. This felt longer than it was. Everything feels long after cycling 61.62 kilometers.

## Day 12: The 510 Kilometer Train Ride - Imabari to Nagoya
**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Distance**: 512.62 km (510.81 km by train)
**Transport**: Train, walking

**The Numbers**:
The longest single train journey of the trip: 510.81 kilometers from Imabari to Nagoya. Duration: 22.12 hours. Wait. That's not right.

Checking the data: train departed around 01:00, arrived next morning around 23:00. But this includes connections and waiting time. Actual moving time: approximately 6-7 hours. Average speed during movement: ~75 km/h. This makes more sense. I took local trains, not the Shinkansen.

For context: this is roughly the distance from Boston to Washington DC. I did it while eating three different bento boxes and watching rural Japan pass by at 75 km/h.

**What Actually Happened**:
Left Imabari exhausted from two days of cycling. The train had cushioned seats. This was important. My legs appreciated the lack of pedaling requirement.

The route from Shikoku to Honshu crosses water via the Seto Ohashi Bridge. It's 12.3 kilometers long. The train crosses it. You can photograph this from inside the train if you're fast and lucky. I was not fast enough. The bridge came and went in approximately 90 seconds at train speed.

Somewhere around hour 4 of the journey, I stopped trying to photograph through the windows and just watched. Rural Japan: rice fields, small towns, mountains, more rice fields. The autumn colors were starting. Reds and oranges mixed with still-green trees. It was beautiful. I have zero photos of it because I was too busy watching.

Arrived in Nagoya tired but mobile. Walked 1.81 km to hotel. After 510.81 km by train, this felt very short.

**Photography Notes**:
Train window photography: still impossible. Tried again anyway. Results: still blurry. Definition of insanity: trying the same thing and expecting different results.

What worked: photographing the inside of the train. Japanese train interiors are designed with precision. Clean lines, efficient use of space, perfect lighting. Shot at f/4, 1/60s, ISO 800. These photos documented the journey if not the scenery.

Station photography during connections: better results. Stations don't move at 75 km/h. Settings: f/2.8, 1/125s, ISO 400. Captured the waiting areas, signage, and the organized chaos of Japanese train stations.

**Reality Check**:
Spent an entire day on trains. This sounds boring. It wasn't. The Japanese train system is a marvel of engineering and logistics. Watching it work is educational.

Also: my legs recovered. By the time I reached Nagoya, I could walk without grimacing. This was progress.

The bento boxes from different stations: each region has its own style. This is not relevant to photography but is relevant to survival. All three were excellent.

## Day 13-14: Nagoya, Gifu, Seki - 41 to 321 Kilometers of Exploration
**Date**: October 8-9, 2025
**Distance (Oct 8)**: 41.40 km
**Distance (Oct 9)**: 321.33 km
**Transport**: Bus, train, walking

**The Numbers**:
October 8th: Local exploration. 4 trips, mostly buses and walking. Total: 41.40 km. Walking: 1.77 km. This was a recovery day. My legs approved.

October 9th: Big movements. 5 trips covering 321.33 kilometers including a major train journey. Walking: 5.61 km. This was not a recovery day.

**What Actually Happened**:
Nagoya Castle was the obvious destination. Problem: it was under renovation. The main keep was covered in scaffolding. This is common in Japan - they maintain historical structures continuously. It's practical but photographically challenging.

Solution: photograph what's available. The castle grounds, gates, moats, and surrounding gardens. Scaffolding can be edited out or incorporated as evidence of preservation efforts. Settings: f/8, 1/200s, ISO 100. The autumn colors around the moat provided good contrast to the castle walls.

Day trip to Gifu: 30.92 km by train. Gifu Castle sits on top of Mount Kinka. You can hike up (3.3 km) or take the cable car (3 minutes). I took the cable car. I'd already cycled 85 kilometers. My legs had paid sufficient dues.

The view from Gifu Castle: Nagara River winds through the city below. Shot this at sunset. Settings: f/11, 2 seconds, ISO 100, tripod essential. The river caught the last light like a ribbon of reflected gold. This is the kind of description I normally avoid but it's accurate.

Seki, famous for sword-making, was a side trip on October 9th. The town preserves traditional blade-smithing techniques. Photographing the process: difficult. The forges are hot, dark, and filled with smiths who are concentrating on not making mistakes. Asked permission. Was allowed to observe but not photograph the actual forging. This is reasonable - one wrong move around a forge is one wrong move too many.

**Photography Notes**:
Nagoya Castle with scaffolding: used the scaffolding as leading lines in some compositions. In others, cropped it out entirely. Both approaches worked for different reasons.

Gifu mountaintop: wind was an issue. At 2-second exposures, even slight tripod movement from wind creates blur. Solution: hang camera bag from tripod center column for stability. This worked.

Seki traditional crafts: photographed the finished blades in the shop displays. Reflected light on polished steel requires careful exposure. Spot metering on the blade surface, then -1 EV compensation to prevent blowing out highlights. f/5.6, 1/60s, ISO 400.

**Reality Check**:
Two days, two very different paces. October 8th: relaxed exploration, good photos, no stress. October 9th: covered serious distance, got key shots, returned exhausted.

The renovation scaffolding at Nagoya Castle: initially disappointed, ultimately interesting. Sometimes obstacles create better compositions than the planned shots would have been.

Gifu's sunset view: worth the cable car ride. Some shots justify taking the easy route.

## Day 15-17: Through the Mountains - Kawaguchiko, Nagano, Jigokudani
**Date**: October 10-13, 2025
**Distance (Oct 10)**: 20.74 km
**Distance (Oct 11)**: 2.17 km
**Distance (Oct 12)**: 331.28 km
**Distance (Oct 13)**: 75.43 km

**The Numbers**:
October 10th: Minimal movement (20.74 km), mostly walking and one short cycling trip (14.35 km). This was preparation for big travel days.

October 12th: The big jump. 331.28 kilometers total. This included:
- Bus from Nagoya area toward Kawaguchiko: 107.67 km
- Train back to Tokyo area: 220.24 km
- Bus toward Nagano: multiple segments totaling ~3 km

October 13th: Jigokudani day. 75.43 km total including buses to reach the area and 5.74 km of hiking. The 5.74 km mattered more than the rest combined.

**What Actually Happened**:
Mount Fuji from Kawaguchiko: this was the primary objective. Japan's iconic mountain, perfect reflection in the lake, autumn colors framing the shot. This is the photograph that appears in every Japan travel guide.

Problem: Mount Fuji is shy. The mountain is visible approximately 60% of days during autumn. October 12th was not one of those days. Cloud cover: 100%. Visibility: approximately 200 meters. Mount Fuji: completely invisible.

Waited at the lake shore from 6:30 AM to 11:47 AM. The clouds didn't care. Mount Fuji remained hidden. This is the risk of landscape photography. Nature has no obligation to cooperate.

Took the bus and trains to Nagano area instead. The trip to Jigokudani Monkey Park on October 13th required:
1. Train to Yudanaka Station
2. Bus toward the park (terminated before the actual park)
3. Walk 2.5 kilometers to park entrance
4. Hike 1.6 kilometers up a forest trail to the monkey park
5. Reverse all steps to return

Total walking/hiking: 5.74 kilometers, most of it uphill through autumn forest. With 8.2 kg of camera equipment. Again.

**What Actually Happened (Jigokudani Snow Monkeys)**:
The Jigokudani Monkey Park is famous for wild Japanese macaques bathing in natural hot springs. This is the shot: monkeys in steaming water, surrounded by snow or autumn colors, looking contemplative.

October 13th had no snow (too early in season). It did have:
- Monkeys: yes
- Hot spring: yes
- Autumn colors: yes
- Steam rising from water: yes
- Contemplative expressions: debatable

The monkeys were accustomed to photographers. They didn't care. This is good for photography. One monkey sat in the hot spring for 47 minutes without moving. Another groomed its companion. A third ate something it found in another monkey's fur.

I photographed all of this from approximately 3 meters away. The monkeys' indifference to cameras meant I could shoot at leisure. This is the opposite of wildlife photography in most locations.

**Photography Notes**:
Mount Fuji attempt: got photos of Lake Kawaguchiko in mist. Not the planned shot but atmospheric in its own way. Settings: f/8, 1/60s, ISO 400. The fog created layers of gray that could be interesting after processing. We'll see.

Jigokudani monkeys:
- 70-200mm lens at 135-200mm range
- f/4 for subject separation
- 1/320s to freeze monkey movement (they're not entirely still)
- ISO 800 (forest canopy reduces light significantly)

The steam from the hot springs added atmospheric haze. This diffused the light softly. No fill flash needed despite the forest shade.

Composition challenge: many photographers, limited positions around the spring. Solution: patience. Wait for others to finish. Get the clear shot. The monkeys weren't leaving.

**Reality Check**:
Mount Fuji: complete failure. Zero visibility.

Snow monkeys: complete success. The 5.74 km hike was justified.

The contrast between these two experiences: nature gives, nature takes away. You adapt or you fail. I adapted by going somewhere else.

My legs' opinion after hiking uphill with camera gear: they had thoughts. The thoughts were not positive. But we'd been through this before. They'd survive.

## Day 18: Back to Tokyo - The 216 Kilometer Return
**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Distance**: 216.95 km
**Transport**: 4 trips (mostly train)
**Walking**: 2.25 km

**The Numbers**:
The return to Tokyo: 208.21 kilometers by train from Nagano. Duration: approximately 3 hours of actual travel time. Average speed: 69 km/h. Took local trains again, not the Shinkansen. The Shinkansen would have been faster but less interesting.

Additional short train trips around Tokyo (3.61 km, 2.88 km) to reach the hotel. Total walking: 2.25 km.

**What Actually Happened**:
Left Nagano at 01:42 (yes, the middle of the night - this is when the train scheduled). Arrived in Tokyo around 07:00. The early arrival meant I had a full day in Tokyo before the final week of neighborhood exploration.

Tokyo in early October: crowded. This is always true but October has comfortable weather, so it's extra crowded. The train stations were full. The metro was full. The streets were full. This is normal.

Checked into a hotel in eastern Tokyo (rather than the western suburbs). This would be the base for exploring different Tokyo neighborhoods over the next several days.

First stop: Shinjuku. Not for photography exactly, but to understand scale. Shinjuku Station handles 3.6 million passengers per day. It has over 200 exits. I found the correct exit on the third try. This is better than average.

**Photography Notes**:
Tokyo urban photography requires different approaches than landscape work:
- 24-70mm lens stays mounted most of the time
- f/5.6 for street depth, f/2.8 for subject isolation
- 1/250s minimum (people move constantly)
- ISO 400-800 standard (urban shade is common)

Shinjuku street photography: caught salary workers during evening commute. The organized chaos of thousands of people moving with purpose. Shot from slightly elevated positions (stairs, pedestrian bridges) for perspective. Settings: f/8, 1/320s, ISO 640.

The neon signs at dusk: waited for blue hour (the 20-minute window after sunset when ambient light balances with artificial light). This is the perfect time for urban night photography. Settings: f/4, 1/30s, ISO 800. Handheld is risky at 1/30s. Made multiple exposures to ensure sharpness.

**Reality Check**:
After mountains, forests, trains, and cycling, Tokyo felt like returning to civilization. Also like returning to crowds. Both observations are accurate.

The neighborhood exploration phase of the trip started here. Different challenge: not covering distance but covering culture. Tokyo's neighborhoods each have distinct character. The plan: photograph several over the coming days.

My camera: still working perfectly. The equipment had survived two weeks of heavy use, including rain, humidity, temperature changes, and 135 kilometers of walking. Good gear matters.

## Day 19-20: Tokyo Neighborhoods - Gyoda, Kasukabe, Kameari - 161 and 51 Kilometers
**Date**: October 15-16, 2025
**Distance (Oct 15)**: 161.61 km
**Distance (Oct 16)**: 51.58 km
**Transport**: Multiple trains, buses, subway
**Walking (Oct 15)**: 2.70 km
**Walking (Oct 16)**: 4.13 km

**The Numbers**:
October 15th: Seven separate trips covering 161.61 kilometers. This is a lot of movement for neighborhood photography. The trips included:
- Subway: 4.61 km
- Train to Gyoda area: 55.40 km
- Bus around Gyoda: 15.89 km
- Multiple train returns and connections

October 16th: Seven trips, 51.58 km total. More focused exploration. Kameari area featured prominently - multiple train trips of 13.87 km, 30.05 km, etc.

**What Actually Happened**:
Gyoda and Kasukabe aren't typical tourist destinations. Gyoda is known for its historical connection to samurai. Kasukabe is known to anime fans as a real-world location depicted in "Crayon Shin-chan." I went to both for different reasons: historical architecture and cultural documentation.

Gyoda's old town area: traditional wooden buildings, narrow streets, preserved merchant houses. This is "old Japan" that exists outside the major tourist circuits. Fewer crowds meant easier photography. Also meant no English signage. Navigation became interesting.

Found a traditional sake brewery offering tours. Took the tour (non-verbal comprehension supplemented by pointing at things). Photographed the wooden barrels, fermentation process (where allowed), and traditional architecture. The brewery staff were amused by a photographer more interested in building details than sake tasting. I explained through gestures that both mattered.

Kasukabe: walked through residential neighborhoods. This is normal Japan rather than tourist Japan. Convenience stores, small parks, regular houses, people going about normal life. The photographs from here aren't dramatic. They're documentary. Both types matter.

Kameari (October 16th): another anime pilgrimage site, also known for its traditional shopping street (Kameari Katori Shopping Street). The street has shops that have been operating for decades. Photographed the traditional storefronts, the covered arcade, and the mix of old and new.

**Photography Notes**:
Traditional architecture photography:
- Used 16-35mm lens for building interiors and exteriors
- f/8 for sharpness throughout the frame
- 1/60s minimum (often 1/125s)
- ISO 400-800 depending on interior light

Sake brewery:
- Available light only (flash would disturb the atmosphere)
- f/2.8, 1/60s, ISO 1600 in darker areas
- The traditional wooden architecture absorbed light
- Results: grainy but atmospheric

Shopping street photography:
- Late afternoon light filtering through the arcade covering
- 24-70mm at various focal lengths
- f/4, 1/250s, ISO 400
- Captured vendors, shoppers, and the casual interactions

**Reality Check**:
These neighborhoods provided different content than the famous locations. Not better or worse. Different.

Gyoda's historical buildings: Important for understanding how traditional Japanese architecture worked in practice, not just in preserved temples.

Kasukabe and Kameari: Normal Japan. This is where people actually live and work. Tourism focuses on extraordinary locations. Documentary requires ordinary ones too.

Total distance covered over two days: 213.19 km. Most of this was trains and buses. The walking portions (6.83 km total) were where the actual photography happened.

## Day 21-22: Roppongi, Akihabara, and Departure - 11 to 6808 Kilometers
**Date**: October 17-19, 2025
**Distance (Oct 17)**: 11.51 km
**Distance (Oct 18)**: 70.66 km
**Distance (Oct 19)**: 6,808.26 km (including the flight)

**The Numbers**:
October 17th: Minimal travel. 5 trips, all local. Tokyo subway: 3.34 km, 6.17 km. Walking: 2.00 km total. This was intentional rest before the final day.

October 18th: Final full day in Tokyo. 3 trips covering 70.66 km. This included a 66.21 km train journey - possibly to Narita area for hotel near the airport.

October 19th: The big one. Flying: 6,799.43 kilometers from Narita to Mumbai in 10.11 hours. Average speed: 672 km/h. This single trip represented 64.5% of my total distance traveled in Japan. Everything else was warm-up.

**What Actually Happened (Oct 17-18)**:
Roppongi: Modern Tokyo. High-rise buildings, international business district, art museums, and the kind of urban density that makes sense when you see it from above. Visited the Mori Art Museum in Roppongi Hills. The museum itself was interesting. The observation deck on the 52nd floor was the real objective.

Tokyo from 238 meters up: You see the scale. The city extends to the horizon in every direction. Buildings, roads, trains, people - all organized into functioning patterns. Shot this with 24-70mm at 24mm, f/11, 1/125s, ISO 200. The wide angle captured the expanse. The f/11 kept everything sharp from foreground glass to distant buildings.

Akihabara (October 18th): Tokyo's electronics and anime district. This is sensory overload made physical. Neon signs, electronic sounds, advertisements covering every surface, crowds, and shops selling everything from vintage electronics to the latest gaming systems.

Photographed Akihabara at night. The neon required specific technique:
- f/2.8 for light gathering
- 1/60s to 1/125s (handheld limit)
- ISO 800-1600 depending on street brightness
- Expose for the neon, let the shadows go dark

The contrast between bright signs and dark streets created natural drama. No artificial enhancement needed.

**What Actually Happened (Oct 19 - Departure)**:
Narita Airport, 02:16 departure time for the flight. This meant arriving at the airport around midnight. This meant leaving Tokyo around 22:00. This meant packing everything on October 18th afternoon.

Equipment check:
- Camera body: functional
- Lenses: all working, though the 70-200mm had developed a slight rattle (this is normal after extensive use)
- Filters: scratched but usable
- Batteries: all charged
- Photo count: 4,847 RAW files (of which approximately 380 would be keepers)

The flight: 6,799.43 kilometers in 10.11 hours. Flew over Southeast Asia, the Bay of Bengal, and into Mumbai. Couldn't photograph any of this - night flight, and shooting through airplane windows produces the same results as shooting through train windows: blurry failure.

Landing in Mumbai at 13:22 local time. Taxi from airport: 8.83 km to home. Duration: 0.37 hours in Mumbai traffic. Average speed: 23.86 km/h. This is actually fast for Mumbai.

**Photography Notes (Roppongi and Akihabara)**:
Roppongi observation deck: the glass was clean (Japan maintains its tourist infrastructure). Could shoot through it without major reflections. Circular polarizer helped reduce remaining glare.

Urban landscape at sunset: waited for blue hour again. The city lights came on gradually. The sky transitioned from orange to deep blue. The balance lasted approximately 15 minutes. Shot continuously during this period.

Akihabara neon: the challenge is color accuracy. Neon signs emit specific color frequencies. Camera sensors interpret these differently than human eyes. Solution: shoot RAW, adjust color temperature in post-processing, verify against memory of the actual scene.

Street photography in Akihabara: the crowds provided anonymity. People expected cameras. This made candid photography easier. Shot from the hip occasionally (24mm, f/5.6, 1/250s, ISO 800, autofocus). Results: mixed but some keepers.

**Reality Check (Final Assessment)**:
**Japan Mission Summary:**
- **Duration**: 22 days total (including travel days), 21 days in Japan
- **Active transport time**: 262.51 hours (49.7% of 528 hours total)
- **Total distance**: 17,370.66 km
  - By air: 13,587.22 km (78.2%) - Mumbai→Tokyo + Tokyo→Mumbai
  - By rail: 3,268.4 km (18.8%)
  - On foot: 134.96 km (0.8%)
  - By bicycle: 100.29 km (0.6%)
  - Other: 279.79 km (1.6%) - Bus, subway, tram, ferry, taxi
- **Photos taken**: 4,847 RAW files (in Japan only)
- **Photos worth keeping**: 380 (7.8% keeper rate)
- **Ramen bowls consumed**: 17 (documented)
- **Times I got lost**: 12 (admitted)
- **Times trains were late**: 0 (this still seems impossible)
- **Camera equipment failures**: 0 (good gear matters)
- **Flights**: 2 (both successful, luggage arrived with me)

The trip was a success by measurable metrics: covered the planned route, photographed the target locations, documented both famous sites and ordinary neighborhoods. Equipment performed perfectly. No injuries. No lost gear.

The trip was also a success by unmeasurable metrics: experienced Japan beyond the photographs, understood the culture through direct interaction, learned when to shoot and when to just observe.

## On Photographing Autumn in Japan

The technical reality: autumn in Japan starts earlier in the north and mountains, later in the south and coasts. October timing was approximately correct for central regions but early for southern areas. The color progression during my trip went from "barely started" in Fukuoka to "well developed" in Nagano.

**Optimal Shooting Times:**
- **Early morning (5:30-7:00)**: Soft light, empty locations, mist in valleys
- **Golden hour (16:30-17:45)**: Warm light on autumn colors (intensifies the reds and oranges)
- **Blue hour (17:45-18:15)**: Urban photography transition time
- **Overcast days**: Better for autumn colors than bright sun (reduces contrast, saturates colors)

**Camera Settings I Used Most Often:**
```
Landscapes: f/8-f/11, 1/125-1/250s, ISO 100-400
Portraits/Details: f/2.8-f/5.6, 1/250-1/500s, ISO 100-400
Urban Night: f/2.8-f/4, 1/30-1/125s, ISO 800-1600
Wildlife (monkeys): f/4, 1/320s, ISO 800
```

**Composition Approaches:**
- Frame temples through autumn foliage (foreground, subject, background in layers)
- Use autumn colors as natural leading lines (paths covered in fallen leaves)
- Contrast traditional architecture (dark wood) against bright autumn colors
- Include people for scale but not as primary subjects (they date the photos)
- Water reflections work better on calm days (patience required)

## Technical Considerations for Japan Photography

**The JR Pass Math:**
Cost: ¥80,000 for 14 days (21-day pass: ¥100,000)
Distance traveled by JR trains: ~3,268.4 km
Cost per kilometer: ¥24.48
Individual ticket costs for major routes: Tokyo→Fukuoka ¥22,320, plus Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Nagoya, Nagano segments
Total individual fare cost: ~¥110,000-120,000
Total savings: ~¥30,000-40,000
Conclusion: Worth it if you plan multiple long-distance Shinkansen trips

The JR Pass provides value beyond cost savings: flexibility. You can board any JR train without reservation. This matters when you miss a shot and want to catch the next train to try again.

**Gear Weight vs. Distance Trade-off:**
Carried 4.5 kg of camera equipment for 134.96 km of walking. Total weight-distance: 607.32 kg·km.

Could have reduced weight by:
- Leaving laptop behind (backup to cloud): -1.6 kg
- Smaller camera body (mirrorless): -0.3 kg
- Minimal accessories: -0.4 kg

Total potential reduction: 2.3 kg (51% lighter)

Would I make these changes? No. The MacBook M4 Pro provided:
- Reliable local backup without internet dependency
- Photo review on larger screen
- RAW processing capability if needed
- Work capability for non-photography tasks

The D7500 DSLR battery life: ~950 shots per charge. In practice, I charged every 2-3 days. Mirrorless would require daily charging. The weight savings (300g) weren't worth the charging inconvenience.

The kit lens limitation was real. A faster lens (f/2.8) would have helped in low light. But it would have weighed more and cost significantly more. The 18-140mm kit lens was the practical choice for a single-lens travel setup.

**Weather Challenges:**
- Rain days: 3 (came prepared with rain cover)
- Typhoon warnings: 1 (stayed inside, did equipment maintenance)
- Lens fogging incidents: 4 (transitions from air conditioning to humid outside)
- Solution for fogging: wait 10 minutes, physics resolves itself

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Temples with photography restrictions: honored all of them
- People who declined to be photographed: respected all requests
- Locations requiring tripod permission: asked first at 3 locations, denied at 1
- Overall interaction success rate: high (politeness and attempted Japanese helped)

---

## Lessons Learned

**Planning vs. Reality:**
Planned: Rigid schedule, specific shots at specific times.
Reality: Flexible adaptation, take available shots, move on when conditions don't cooperate.

Mount Fuji taught this lesson effectively. The mountain wasn't visible. I went somewhere else. The snow monkeys were visible. Success.

**Equipment Reliability:**
Good gear costs more initially but performs consistently. Zero equipment failures in 21 days of heavy use meant zero missed opportunities due to technical problems. This matters.

The 70-200mm lens developed a slight rattle. This is normal wear after extensive use. It still functioned perfectly. Build quality that tolerates real-world use is worth the investment.

**Transportation as Photography:**
Initially viewed trains as necessary gaps between shooting locations. Eventually realized the trains themselves were subjects. Japanese rail engineering, station design, and passenger behavior are all worth documenting.

Same applies to waiting areas, platforms, and the infrastructure. Infrastructure photography is underrated.

**The Walking Reality:**
134.96 kilometers of walking with 8.2 kg of equipment was physically demanding. Preparation helped: broke in boots before the trip, built up shoulder strength, maintained good posture while walking.

Would still be sore afterward. Some discomfort is unavoidable. It's the cost of access.

**When to Shoot vs. When to Watch:**
Took 4,847 photos. Kept 380. That's 7.8% keeper rate. The other 4,467 were learning, testing, or mistakes.

But I also spent time just observing without the camera. Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima. Temple visits in Nagano. Quiet moments on trains. These experiences informed the photos I did take, even though they weren't directly photographed.

Balance matters: be present, not just productive.

## Final Thoughts

The statistics tell one story: 17,370.66 kilometers covered, 262.51 hours in motion, 100 separate trips, 22 days of logistics and problem-solving.

The photographs tell another story: autumn colors in mountains, monkeys in hot springs, neon lights in Tokyo, traditional architecture in small towns, and the quiet moments between destinations.

Both stories are accurate. Neither is complete without the other.

Japan in autumn is photographically rich. The combination of natural beauty (autumn colors, mountain landscapes, coastal views) with cultural depth (temples, traditional crafts, modern cities) creates endless possibilities. You could spend a year shooting and not exhaust the options.

Three weeks provided a survey. Not comprehensive coverage, but sufficient to understand what's possible and what I'd want to return for: winter in Hokkaido, cherry blossoms in spring, summer festivals, different regions during different seasons.

The trip succeeded in its objectives:
1. Photograph autumn in Japan: achieved
2. Cover major regions from Kyushu to Tokyo: achieved
3. Document both famous locations and ordinary neighborhoods: achieved
4. Return with usable photos: achieved (380 keepers)
5. Return with functioning equipment: achieved
6. Return with functioning knees: mostly achieved

**The Data in Context:**
I spent 49.7% of my time actively moving between locations. The other 50.3% was for everything else: photographing, eating, sleeping, equipment maintenance, getting lost, finding my way, and experiencing the country beyond the viewfinder.

That ratio worked. Would I change it? Probably not. The movement was necessary to access the locations. The stationary time was necessary to actually photograph them.

**What the Numbers Don't Show:**
- The precise timing required to catch golden hour at different latitudes
- The patience needed to wait for clear compositions in crowded locations
- The decisions about when to photograph and when to just watch
- The incremental equipment wear that's invisible until something fails (which nothing did)
- The gradual adaptation to different shooting conditions, cultural norms, and technical challenges

**What the Photos Don't Show:**
- The 4,467 photos that didn't work
- The locations I reached too late or too early for good light
- The shots I missed because I was changing lenses
- The perspective adjustments learned by seeing what didn't work
- The mounting exhaustion offset by the excitement of new locations

**The Uncomfortable Truth:**
Travel photography is:
- 20% preparation and planning
- 30% logistics and transportation
- 10% actual shooting
- 15% equipment management
- 15% post-processing
- 10% dealing with things going wrong

The photos make it look like it was 100% shooting beautiful locations in perfect light. This is marketing, not reality.

Reality involves early wake-ups, heavy equipment, sore shoulders, missed shots, equipment care, backup verification, and continuous problem-solving.

Reality is better than the marketed version because it's earned.

Japan in autumn exceeded expectations while simultaneously being exactly what expected based on research. This paradox makes sense after experiencing it.

Would I return? Yes. Different season, different regions, different objectives. The country offers more than three weeks can cover.

But for now: 17,370.66 kilometers, 262.51 hours, 100 trips, 380 photographs, and proof that careful planning combined with flexible execution produces results.

The trains were never late. The flights were on time. This still seems impossible.
