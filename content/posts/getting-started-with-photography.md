## Introduction to Photography

Photography is an art form that allows you to capture moments, tell stories, and express creativity. Whether you're using a smartphone or a professional camera, understanding the basics will help you take better photos.

### The Exposure Triangle

Understanding exposure is fundamental to photography. The three elements that control exposure are:

1. **Aperture (f-stop)** - Controls depth of field and light
2. **Shutter Speed** - Controls motion blur and light
3. **ISO** - Controls sensor sensitivity and noise

### Composition Basics

Good composition makes the difference between a snapshot and a photograph:

- **Rule of Thirds** - Divide your frame into a 3x3 grid
- **Leading Lines** - Use natural lines to guide the viewer's eye
- **Framing** - Use elements in the scene to frame your subject
- **Negative Space** - Don't be afraid of empty space

### Camera Settings

Start with these recommended settings for beginners:

```
Mode: Aperture Priority (A/Av)
Aperture: f/5.6 for general shooting
ISO: Auto (100-800 range)
White Balance: Auto
Focus Mode: Single-point AF
```

### Practice Tips

The best way to improve is through practice:

- Shoot every day, even if just with your phone
- Study photos you admire
- Join photography communities
- Experiment with different subjects
- Review and critique your own work

### Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore these areas:

- Portrait photography
- Landscape photography
- Street photography
- Macro photography
- Night photography

Remember, every professional photographer was once a beginner. Keep practicing and have fun!
